DESCRIPTION:Submit a pdf with screenshots of your notebook with output. The
  screenshots should be cropped and clear enough to see code and output wit
 hout zooming in more than once. Please do not take screenshots with your p
 hone\, taking screenshots on your machine is super easy\, just google it i
 f you are not sure how to do it. Thanks for the effort!\n\nPlease - See ma
 terial in related Page and Files folder and announcements.\n\nTask: Fill i
 n the blanks for the given regular expressions in the code (file below) an
 d submit a PDF per instructions above.\n\nGrading: Since this is practice 
 I will give the participation points for your effort and you will not lose
  points if you are little/somewhat incorrect. Very incomplete subs or thos
 e that are far from a correct regex for this task will likely lose points.
 \n\nWe will discuss the solution in next class so please bring questions t
 hen. In the meantime\, you are welcome to ask questions in office hours\, 
 anything other than a quick question over email is not possible to answer.

 \n* Images must be cropped and clear/easy to see without much effort\, for
  someone who needs to check about 25 subs please!\n\nAs it is participatio

 tes\, delaying this will likely hurt your progress so it is your responsib
 ility to be aware of what is going on in class when you missed a meeting).
 \n\nThe goal is for everyone to start working on the project1. See any ann
 ouncements and Page [Project 1] (https://fgcu.instructure.com/courses/5558

 counter issues\, e.g. there might be blanks or missing values or formattin
 g issues. In summary\, there are always issues when dealing with data\, an
 d many ways to work around these issues: e.g.\, for some\, dropna() might 
 work\, you might need to do dropna(inplace=True). Others used "text.values
 .astype('U')" to convert their text data variable.\n\nPlease submit a pdf 
 by the deadline with:\n\n* your names\n\n* a half page description for EAC
 H of the two datasets (200 or so words) IN YOUR OWN WORDS\, including:\n\n
 * for any numbers\, it helps if you use a table or bulleted lists rather t
 han embedding numbers in text \n\n* what are we trying to predict here? w
 hat do the class labels 0 and 1 represent? (see the Page above for my copy
  of the description of each dataset\, just write 1-2 sentence summary for 
 each dataset)\n\n* how many records in each file (train vs dev) \n\n* how
  many records for each class label in each file (train vs dev)\n\n* the nu
 mber of unique terms or tokens in each file (train vs dev). For this you c
 an use the scikit-learn code we have already used for vectorizers\, see th
 e previous notebooks. There are other ways to do this and of course feel f
 ree to google or use other tools to find out. This particular part is only
  worth up to 2 points out of 10.\n\nAttention: the data is likely too larg
 e for colab and/or the vectorizer or other things you try using scikit-lea
 rn. Just use a subset of the data that does fit in memory instead of submi
 tting nothing (e.g. the first 10K records or if that does not work the fir
 st 5K records and so on. Make sure to have a representative sample of the 
 labels\, for example it would be bad to have only 0 labels records in that
  subset). Briefly describe what you did in 1 sentence\, clear and specific
 .\n\nThis first submission is to show effort and that you explored the dat
 a so I will grade this more leniently than the final sub for the project.\
 n\nIf you have questions please do not wait for the last minute\, instead 
 plan to stop by office hours ahead of the deadline. Also if you need help 
 with code\, please come to class with questions or code to show me\, it is
  hard to review code in submissions and then help you later.

 pages/star-project-1)\n\nYou must follow the instructions here and the Pro
 ject1 Page(s) with the specific datasets\, please do not do something else
  and expect points.\n\nThe general goal is to train 2 different classifier
  models in scikit-learn for each dataset given in the related Page (for ex
 ample\, fit one model on the train set of the triage data and test it on d
 ev set of the triage data).\n\nYour starting point should be the spam clas

  sure to follow only what you need for this assignment and change the code
  accordingly for *each* dataset.\n\n* One of the classifiers can be the mu
 ltinomial NB (as in the spam notebook). Then you have to find and use anot
 her model (NOT another NB\, find other models in the scikit-learn models\,
  e.g. SVC or decision tree or neural network or ...).\n\n* You must experi
 ment with 1) a count vectorizer and then 2) a tfidf vectorizer.\n\n* You m
 ust report accuracy\, precision\, and recall for each run.\n\n* For the da
 ta\, some small manipulations outside of code are ok\, if you describe it 
 in your report and your code. For example\, they use the | separator for t
 he "text | label"\, so look up pandas read csv with different separators (
 default is comma). There are apparently issues with missing data which you
  could fix in code or open and fix in MS Excel.\n\n* In general\, the code
  is a good part of this\, but a big part is the set up of the experiments\
 , the quality of the report\, etc.\n\n*What to submit*\n\nA pdf that inclu
 des:\n\n* The names of all group members\n\n* Your link to your google col
 ab notebook inside the PDF -- Make sure the link is OPEN to ANYONE to view
  the notebook.\n\n* The link must be inside the PDF with the names\, not i
 n the comments on Canvas.\n\n* Make sure that your code (notebook) has Sec
 tions and some comments so that I am able to go through it without too muc
 h effort.\n\n* I need to see the outputs of each cells in the notebook. Ha
 ving just 1-2 cells is an issues\, follow the examples I provided for how 
 to structure cells.\n\n* Functions\, object-oriented etc. are not part of 
 this\, so follow the examples I provided for the script.\n\n* For EACH dat
 aset\, a table with all the related results from your runs using the follo
 wing template:\n\n[table results-1.png] (https://fgcu.instructure.com/cour
 ses/555851/files/53593976/preview)\n\n4. A short paragraph (about 150 word
 s\, overly verbose answers might lose points\, it is a talent to briefly a
 nd succinctly convey your thoughts!) with a summary / conclusions\, e.g. w
 hat is the best result for each case\, what did you observe etc. Imagine s
 omeone just reading this paragraph to see what has been done for this data
  so they can run their own experiments or compare to your results.\n\n*\n\
 n* Any use of GenAI generated text\, or generic filler text that looks lik
 e it came from such as source and adds no actual value to your answer or u
 nderstanding of the data or results will result in a "0" grade for the sub
 mission. Please write your own answers\, summaries etc.\n\n* Since you hav
 e 2 classification models and 2 vectorizers in #3 for each dataset\, you h
 ave a total of 2x2=4\, *from which* to pick the best result for each datas
 et.\n\n* For the "best" result in each dataset\, also show the confusion m
 atrix in your answer for part #4.\n\n* How you pick the best result (e.g. 
 based only on accuracy or looking at the confusion matrix or ...) is up to
  you if the numbers are not clearly the best for one of the results. You m
 ust * explain your thinking and clearly say which model+vectorizer combo w
 on and why *.\n\n* Whenever you are presenting a lot of numbers it should 
 be in tabular format with appropriate header rows/titles\, or you may use 
 bullets etc. The reader should not have to read and find/compare different
  numbers in a long text paragraph. Of course\, if you are simply mentionin
 g one or two numerical results referring to the table in #3\, that is fine
